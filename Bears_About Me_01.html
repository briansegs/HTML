  <p>Hey, my name is Brian, and there's little I find more exciting than Pizza! 
      I've spent most of my young life traveling to the edges of Earth to take pictures of those wonderful nummies.
      I don't know why i have a page about bears but i hope you enjoy!   <br /> <br />

  	Family, Country, Bears, <br /> <br />
